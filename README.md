# yolov7-keypoint-customization
Revision of official yolov7-pose to support custom dataset for keypoint detection<br>
## Statement
"yolov7-keypoint-customization" is for convinient use of keypoint detection. The revision that added custom keypoint support was based on the official yolov7-pose project.<br>
See https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7 for full project please.
## Get started
Before training, you need to revise the configuration in ```./data/custom.yaml``` and ```./cfg/yolov7-w6-pose-custom.yaml```.<br>
In ```./data/custom.yaml```, you need to edit your dataset path, class number and class label as follows:<br>
```
train: ../root_path/your_traget_path/yolo_labels/train.txt <br>
val: ../root_path/your_traget_path/yolo_labels/val.txt      <br>
test: ../root_path/your_traget_path/yolo_labels/val.txt     <br>

nc: 1 #num of class <br>
names: [ 'custom']  # label of each class <br>
```
And the train.txt/val.txt should be filled with corresponding image path (Assumed you have completed the preparation of dataset). <br>
In ```./cfg/yolov7-w6-pose-custom.yaml```, just need to revise the nkpt (number of keypoint in each sample) and nc (class_num).
